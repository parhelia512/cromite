caption: Enable Silent Printing
desc: |-
  Setting this policy to true enables silent printing, which immediately closes
  print preview window when opened and prints to the default printer with
  default options. If the default printer is 'Save as PDF', the file will be
  saved to the Downloads folder.

  Not setting this policy or setting this policy to false disables silent
  printing, which doesn't automatically close print preview window and requires
  the user to make a selection as usual.
