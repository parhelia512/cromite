caption: Prefer specific encryption cipher algorithms for TLS
desc: |-
  This policy configures <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to order its preferred encryption ciphers in TLS 1.3 to reflect a preference for algorithms that have been approved by a specific compliance regime.

  Setting this policy does not guarantee that any specific algorithms will be negotiated.

  This policy exists to allow server operators who wish to support clients with and without compliance requirements to differentiate between those clients, and only use certain non-default algorithms with increased cryptographic strength for those explicitly configured to prefer them.

  Setting the policy to '<ph name="CNSA_NAME">cnsa</ph>' configures <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to prefer ciphers required for compliance with the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite versions 1.0 and 2.0 (CNSA 1.0 and 2.0).

  Not setting the policy, or setting it to '<ph name="DEFAULT_NAME">default</ph>', configures <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to use its default ciphers.

  Setting this policy is not required for security. The default cryptography used by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> is strong enough to withstand a brute force attack using the entire power of the Sun.

  Setting this policy will cause <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> to be slower when accessing websites.

  This policy only affects TLS 1.3 and QUIC; it does not affect earlier versions of TLS.
