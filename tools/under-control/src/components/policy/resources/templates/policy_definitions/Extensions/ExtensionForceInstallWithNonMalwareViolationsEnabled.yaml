caption: Enable Force-installed Extensions With Non-Malware Violations

desc: |-
  Controls whether extensions that are taken down due to non-malware violations can still be force installed in low-trust environments.

  More information about non-malware violations and taken down can be found here. https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/review-process#warning

  Once the non-malware violation has been resolved, the extension will remain enabled and cannot be disabled or removed.

  On <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph>, this policy is not available on instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain, joined to <ph name="MS_AAD_NAME">Microsoft® Azure® Active Directory®</ph> or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Enterprise Core</ph>`.

  On <ph name="MAC_OS_NAME">macOS</ph>, this policy is not available on instances that are managed via MDM, joined to a domain via MCX or enrolled in <ph name="CHROME_BROWSER_CLOUD_MANAGEMENT_NAME">Chrome Enterprise Core</ph>.

  Force-installed extensions with non-malware violations will remain enabled in these instances.

  Currently, a force-installed extension with non-malware violations remains installed and enabled in Chrome.

  Setting the policy to Enabled will cause force-installed extensions to behave the same (i.e., remain enabled) regardless of non-malware violations.

  Setting the policy to Disabled or not setting the policy will cause force-installed extensions with non-malware violations to be disabled.

  This policy will be available for 3 milestones.
